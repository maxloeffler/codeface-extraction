"""
This file is able to disambiguate authors after the extraction from the Codeface database was performed. A manually
created disambiguation file is used to disambiguate the authors in all the extracted files of a project. In addition,
the author "GitHub <noreply@github.com>" is removed from all the data and is either replaced by the actual author or,
if this is not possible, the corresponding event is removed from the data.

The manually created disambiguation file 'disambiguation-after-db.list' has to have the following format:
    - each line combines two person identities which should be mapped to each other
    - each line consists of six columns (each three for describing id, name, e-mail address)
    - the entries of each line are taken from the global 'authors.list' file
    - Example:
        1234;Claus Hunsen;claus.hunsen@example.org;5678;claushunsen;hunsen.claus@example.net;
    - the first three columns of a line describe the person identity to keep (e.g., 1234)
    - the last three columns of a line describe the person identity to replace (e.g., 5678)
Result: Every occurrence of the second person identity will be replaced by the first person identity, in every .list
file of the project (authors, commits, emails, issues, etc.)

If more than two person identities should be mapped to each other, several lines are necessary in the disambiguation
file. E.g., if persons A, B, C should be mapped to A, there has to be a line which replaces B by A (A,B) and a line
which replaces C by A (A,C).
